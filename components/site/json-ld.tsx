/**
 * Inline JSON-LD payload as a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag.
 *
 * Server component — renders once at request time, no client JS. Use one
 * per logical schema (e.g. one for WebSite, one for BreadcrumbList) rather
 * than packing everything into a `@graph` array, since Google's Rich
 * Results test handles both but stand-alone blocks are easier to diff.
 *
 * Safe to interpolate user-supplied strings: React escapes `<`, `>`, `&`
 * inside a JSX text child (this is how `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is
 * avoided). Specifically we do NOT use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; the
 * JSON is rendered as a normal text child so React handles escaping.
